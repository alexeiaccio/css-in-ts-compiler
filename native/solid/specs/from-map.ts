// `timeline.json`, written from `native/docs/map.md`: the map's own plan as its figure, so a step added, renamed or
// reordered in the map is a rewrite here and a `cmp` in solid/test.sh. This is the generated one of the three planning
// specs; `nowNextLater.json` and `statusKey.json` are hand-written, and why is below.
//
//   node native/solid/specs/from-map.ts            rewrites timeline.json here in place
//   node native/solid/specs/from-map.ts <dir>      writes it into <dir> (the check's own way: it writes nothing)
//
// The parse, and what it assumes — narrowly, because the map is prose and a parse that guessed more would lie:
//   — the steps are the numbered bold headings of `## Order of work` (`1. **Done: desktop window.**`), and nothing
//     after that section;
//   — a step's label is its heading after a leading `Done:` (or `Done.`), cut at ` in ` (the rest names the module a
//     step is in, not the step), and, when the heading is a bare `Done.`, the line's first `` `code` `` span;
//   — a step's status is `Done` when its heading begins with it, else `Left` (the map's two words for a step);
//   — its note is the first ISO date the step's section records, if it records one. It is a note and not the `date`
//     field: the dates do not run in the map's order (step 4 records 2026-10-31, step 7 a 2026-10-21), so they cannot
//     be a checked axis. The axis is the order itself: one step is four cells of the 32-cell axis.
//
// `nowNextLater.json` is **not** written here. Its cards are the map's `Left:` lists, and those lines are not machine
// readable enough to group honestly: one opens with a bold note of what was *added* later (`Left: **termbox2 is in** …;
// what a click cannot do is hover`), one turns into a note of what came later after a semicolon, and the now/next/later
// split is a judgement about the map's own order of targets. So the board is hand-written, and figure-planning.test.ts
// holds every card's words to the map's (a card that is not a fragment of a `Left:` line fails there).
