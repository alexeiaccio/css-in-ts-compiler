// `solid/specs/table.json`, written from `native/docs/map.md`'s Targets table: the map's own targets as the generic
// `table` kind's figure, so a target added, renamed or re-worded there is a rewrite here and a `cmp` in
// solid/figure-handoff.sh. `solid/figure-table.test.ts` re-parses the same table and holds every cell to it, so the
// figure cannot drift from the document it documents.
//
//   bun native/solid/specs/from-targets.ts            rewrites table.json here in place
//   bun native/solid/specs/from-targets.ts <dir>      writes it into <dir> (the check's own way: it writes nothing else)
//
// What is drawn, and what is not:
//   — four of the map's six columns: target, raster, JS at run time, status. Styles is `cssints/clay` on every row (a
//     column of one value says nothing), and Layout is Clay on every row but two, where it names a different Clay; the
//     four drawn are the ones whose cells differ from target to target.
//   — a cell's markdown backticks are dropped: a figure's cell is text, and a cell has no inline markup.
//   — `options.max` is 18 cells. The raster's and the status's own sentences are longer than a column may be, so the
//     figure is where the kind's cut (`…`, counted in cells and not bytes) is the real thing and not a test.
//   — the headings are lowercased, as the other tables here print them (`tokenTable`'s group, token and value).
