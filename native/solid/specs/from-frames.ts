// `solid/specs/before-after.json` and `solid/specs/layer-stack.json`, written from frames this script captures: the
// Widgets page's switch off and on, and the Dialog's modal and menu frames — captured the way solid/goldens stores a
// page's last frame (solid/dump.ts). The tree is the same in both frames, so a
// command's index is the same element, and the numbers a before/after is about are the commands whose fields differ: the
// track's colour and the thumb's x. Nothing in the spec is typed by hand but the two states' captions and the two parts'
// names, and `solid/figure-handoff.test.ts` recomputes the same difference to hold the spec to the frames.
//
//   bun solid/specs/from-frames.ts                  # write both specs, here
//   bun solid/specs/from-frames.ts "$TMPDIR/specs"  # ... or into another directory, for solid/test.sh's cmp
//
// Both frames are taken with the switch focused (`Tab,Tab`) and the second with Space after it, so the focus ring is the
// same command in both and the only fields that move are the two the figure is about.
