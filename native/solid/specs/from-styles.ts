// `solid/specs/state-matrix.json`: the states the pages' styles declare. The pages are the ones this repository draws —
// the Widgets, Sky and List pages' `s` maps and the Sensors page's exported styles — and the states are the three Clay
// overlays a style can carry: `:hover`, `:focus` and `:active` (`packages/cssints/src/clay.ts`). A row is a style that
// declares at least one; a cell is whether it declares that one. Nothing here is typed by hand but the display names,
// and `solid/test.sh` regenerates the spec and `cmp`s it, so a state added to a style is a `+` in the same commit.
