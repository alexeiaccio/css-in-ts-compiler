 * `SHADOW_BLUR` is `ui_shadow`'s argument, the blur of the element's shadow (45, one past the packed array).
 *
 * A page writes these from its `View.tick` (before the tree is declared) for the element's `id`. What reads as motion:
 * `OFFSET_X`/`OFFSET_Y` of a float and `SHADOW_BLUR` (a renderer effect, no layout); `EXPAND_W`/`EXPAND_H` and
 * `Z_INDEX` too. `WIDTH`/`HEIGHT`, `PADDING`, `GAP` and the colours are legal but move Clay's layout: a field that
 * changes a box's size re-lays-out its parent and its siblings each frame, so animate a transform-like field, not a size.
