//                                        Enter opens the settings dialog and Space opens the menu; on form Tab reaches the

//   --click2 X Y                         headless: a second press and release, after the wheel, the keys and the settle, for a

//                                        (0..1, so 0.5,0.5 is its middle): the point goes through ui_touch_map, the same
//                                        mapping the window poll gives SDL's finger events, and the frames carry the

//   --warm N                             headless: N frames at rest before the click and the wheel, for a page whose
//                                        mount animation (the Sky cards arriving, the four plain pages' entry) has to be

//   --drag-feed X,Y,DY,DY,...            headless, after --warm: a pointer drag on the Sky feed: a press at X,Y, then
//                                        one frame a pointer moved by that many px in y (the button held), then the
//                                        release at the last point; --settle runs the fling after it
//   --keys Tab,Tab,Space                 headless: a frame, then each key pressed and released with a frame after it
//                                        (names as the focus manager and the parts take them: Shift+Tab, Enter, ArrowLeft,
//                                        Space for " "); the last frame is written. A step `text:Ada` is typed text
//                                        (`Input.textInput`), not a key: --keys Tab,text:Ada,Shift+ArrowLeft
//   --wheel N                            headless, before --keys: the pointer onto the element `--wheel-over` names (the
//                                        list's viewport by default), then N wheel notches down, a frame each (one
//                                        notch is 10px; a run of notches a frame apart is a flick and flings)
//   --wheel-x N                          headless, with --wheel: the same notches along the horizontal axis instead (N to
//                                        the right: the wide List's rows)
//   --wheel-over ID                      the element the wheel's pointer goes onto (default "list")
//   --wheel-rest                         headless, with --wheel: a frame of rest between notches, so a long run is the
//                                        notches' own 10px each (the List's stored frames)
//   --settle N                           headless: N more frames at 1/60 after the wheel and the keys, for a page whose
//                                        motion has to come to rest (the Sky feed's spring and fling, the Dialog's menu
//                                        slide and panel drop)
//   --idle N                             headless, after everything else: N frames with no input, printing how many of
//                                        them drew (a page at rest draws none: "idle: draws 0 of 60")
//   --idle-keys K                        headless with --idle: a Tab pressed every K idle frames, which must draw
//   --bench N                            headless: N more frames, the ms a frame by phase
//   --count N                            the List's rows (default 30): 1,000 is the window's own test page
//   --wide                               the List's wide layout: 900px rows in the same 280px viewport, a horizontal bar,
//                                        and a second column past the viewport's edge (the horizontal axis of the scroll
//                                        machine: --wheel-x scrolls it, and a shift+vertical wheel in the window does too)
//   --posts N                            the Sky's Discover feed: N synthetic posts instead of its three fixtures
//   --density N                          the raster's pixel density (the window's, 2 on a Retina screen): the same layout
//                                        in N times the pixels; the frame written is that much larger (default 1)
//   --raster thorvg|thorvg-gpu           the ThorVG software canvas (the default) or its WebGPU canvas, the frame read
//                                        back; the latter needs a libui.dylib from desktop/build-thorvg-gpu.sh solid
//   --frames N                           window: close after N frames (a smoke test)
//   --reduced-motion                     no travel and no waiting: a retarget lands on its target at once and a node
//                                        that leaves unmounts on the frame it closes (also REDUCED_MOTION=1)
