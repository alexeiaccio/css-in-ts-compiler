# Step 6, the Solid half: one page as Solid on the terminal. `solid/native/term.c` is Clay over terminal/cells.c,
# render.c, measure.c and termbox2 (build/solid/libterm.dylib), `terminal/solid.ts` is solid/main.ts's loop shape on it,
# and the page is `solid/app/Sensors.tsx` unmodified: the host re-cuts page.c's two lengths for cells through the value
# channel (the root's padding and gap, the pill's height) and draws the pill's ring from its own focus, as page.c's
# `pill_style(focused)` does.
#
# The C page is the oracle. At the page's own height (11 cells: the C page's list starts on row 12) the Solid frame is
# the C frame byte for byte, as a dump and as ANSI, dark and light, and after Tab and ArrowDown. At the suite's 20 rows
# the page's first 11 rows are the same and the rows below are the C page's list and footer, which Sensors.tsx does not
# draw: that gap is the one this slice does not close, and the last comparison counts the rows it does.
#
# Runs on its own (from any directory) and from native/test.sh, which calls it after the C page's own checks.

# `homeScreen` (Discover's two pages, Science's one; News has no recording, so it is the app's empty feed) and
# `threadScreen` (one thread, shown for whichever post opened it). `Sky.tsx` asks for them as it asks the AppView
# (`pages`, and the thread's `load`), and draws the answers as its own cards: page 1 when the feed opens, the next when
# the scroll reaches the feed's end (the app's sentinel at the list's end), appended under the reader, never a jump. The
# loading, end and error states are the page's **status line**: a row inside the clip would be out of view exactly at the
# end, because the page's content end is the window's and not the declared rows'.
#
# (a) the first page's rows are the recording's: the `feed_rows` print above (28 of its 30 posts, the app's own
#     moderation rule dropping two), and the status line's count is that number.
# (b) the end asks for the second page: 28 posts to 51, and page 2's rows are drawn (the stored frames).
# (c) a third page (no recording) is the feed's end: the page's words, and its frame stored.
# (d) `--offline` is the error state: the page's words, and no card.
# (e) a page-2 row's Enter opens the recorded thread: the same frame as the thread's own, byte for byte.
# (f) `cmp` of the two stored frames, before and after the second page, and the C feed's count above unchanged in kind.
#
# the page's own state lands a frame after the answer (Solid writes it in the host's flush), so the keys leave a frame

# `createSystemTheme` (terminal/theme.ts): a surface at the background, its step up, the ink at 7:1, the accent from the
# terminal's blue. A pty that answers is a script here (terminal/pty-answer.py): the reply is OSC 11 (a light warm
# background), OSC 10 (a near-black foreground) and two OS 4 entries, the blue and the grey. What the dump proves is the
# page's own colour table: `# colours: index rgb glyphs fills`, so a line is a colour and its cell counts — the same page
# (289 fills of the page, 11 glyphs of the accent, 1309 of the panel) painted with the terminal's colours.
