// The Solid host on the terminal: solid/main.ts's loop shape, over Clay in cells instead of ThorVG in pixels. Two of the
// desktop's pages run here, each **unmodified**; what is the terminal's is the host underneath them, and the lengths the
// C page re-cuts for a cell grid (terminal/page.c's and terminal/sky.c's own, through the value channel, not by
// rewriting a page):
//
//   the Sensors page          the root's padding and gap 64/40/56 px and an 8px gap -> 2 cells of padding and no gap;
//                             the Units pill's height 38 px (2.4 rows) -> 3 cells, so a border, a line of text and a
//                             border are 3 rows; the pill's focus ring is page.c's accent border while it has focus
//
//   the Sky feed              the bar's height 64 px -> 1 cell row and its 16px/20px padding and gap -> 1 cell; the status
//                             line 32 px -> 1 row; a card's 12px padding and 8px gap -> 1 cell of side padding, 0 above and
//                             below; a tab's 6px/10px padding -> 0 and a cell after its label (its label is the row). The
//                             feed's own 12px padding and 8px gap are left as the page's: the page's scroll adds the same
//                             lengths, and in cells the 12px inset is the first card's one-cell gutter and the 8px gap is
//                             the empty row the C page draws as a separator. The avatar is an image: the host skips it,
//                             because a cell has no glyph for it and its 40x40 box would be three rows of nothing the C
//                             page does not draw
//
// Run with Bun:
//
//   bun terminal/solid.ts                  live: termbox2's alternate screen, the page's frame each 16ms, q/Ctrl+C/Escape
//                                          quits; a click toggles the Units pill (the page's own onClick), Tab moves the
//                                          focus off the pill, Space/Enter press it, `t` flips the theme
//   bun terminal/solid.ts --page sky       live: the Sky page — the feed, its thread and its profile (and the settings
//                                          screen), as the desktop has them. Tab reaches the tablist then the feed,
//                                          Left/Right switch the feed, Up/Down, PageUp/PageDown, Home/End scroll it,

//                                          switches the feed, one on a card opens its thread (the page's own onClick, in
//                                          its loading state, then the app's recorded thread: `load`'s promise below),

//                                          flushes the frame a tab switch lands on (the bar's active tab stays), `open`
//                                          drops a card's own onClick (a click and Enter leave the feed), `back` never

//   --mutate channel|wait                  the system theme's two: `channel` reads the answer's foreground as its
//                                          background (a light terminal's frame goes dark), `wait` asks with no timeout (a
//                                          terminal that never answers hangs the host)
//
// The thread and the profile are the page's **screens**, not pages of their own: `Sky.tsx` mounts the thread as a root
// float over the feed and `Profile.tsx`'s `createProfile` is called by `Sky` and its element declared in `Sky`'s tree, so
// there is no `--page profile` here (the C `demo --page profile` is a stack entry point its own host has). They are
// driven as the page drives them: a card's click (or, as the C feed's Enter, the host pressing the first card's onClick
// while the feed is focused) opens the thread, a click on the card's author row opens the profile, Escape is the page's
// back. The thread's `load` is handed a promise the host settles with the app's **recorded** thread
// (apps/csssky/test/fixtures/thread.json through the page's own screenOf, which is the fixture solid/thread.test.ts hands
// it) a frame after the screen mounts: the loading row gets that frame, the app's rows the next. The profile needs
// nothing: `profile.ts` reads the app's recordings itself, on the first opening.

// What it cannot do is a cell's limit, and said in native/README.md: text is one row (a body wraps at words, but a line
// is a cell and a long word is broken nowhere), an image is a skipped box, a group's opacity and translate have no

 * padding and 8px gap are **not** re-cut: the page's scroll arithmetic adds the same lengths (its PAD/GAP), so a host
 * that zeroed them would make the page's content end larger than Clay's and the clip would stop the scroll short of the
 * page's own end — and in cells the 12px inset lands the first card on row 1, the 8px gap is the empty row between cards
 * that the C page draws as its separator. The C pages cut the same lengths by hand; the page's pixels are only touched
 * here.

 * — and 696px — the window less the bar — over the content area, a 44px head with the Back control, a clip of cards): in
 * cells the float sits one row down (the host's bar is one row) and takes the rows under it, the head and the 28px Back
 * are one row each (a 2px border on a one-row control is the row's own cells, box characters), and a card is the feed's.
