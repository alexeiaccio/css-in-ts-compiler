// The Sky page in the browser, on the desktop's own modules: src/renderer.ts (the Solid universal renderer), src/frame.ts
// (one frame: pointer in, events, flush, the tree declared to Clay) and app/Sky.tsx, unmodified. Clay runs in ui.wasm
// (browser/ui.c) through browser/solid/ffi-browser.ts; the commands and the effects beside them (shadows, gradients,
// groups, images) are drawn by browser/draw.js, the same file the no-JS page draws with.
//
// The loop is src/frame.ts's createDrawer: the tree is declared and laid out every iteration, and the canvas is drawn only
// when the frame hash moved or a discrete input came in — a page at rest costs a layout and no pixels, as on the desktop.
// The window's poll is the DOM's: mouse move/down/up, the wheel, and the keys the page's focus manager and its parts take
// (Tab, the arrows, Home/End, PageUp/Down, Escape, Enter, Space).
//
// The page's own data is the app's recorded fixtures (Sky.tsx's Discover/Science/News): a feed of six posts with drawn
// avatars, the gradient cards and their entry. The thread's loader is a promise that never settles — a browser page here
// asks no network, and the check's frames must not depend on one.
