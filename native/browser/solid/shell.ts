// The shell both Solid pages of the browser share: the canvas, Clay in ui.wasm (browser/ui.c through ffi-browser.ts), one
// frame a requestAnimationFrame, the DOM's pointer and keyboard where the desktop's window poll has SDL's, and the object
// browser/solid-check.mjs drives (`window.__page`). A page supplies its tree and, if it takes keys, its `Input`.
//
// The loop is src/frame.ts's createDrawer: the tree is declared and laid out every iteration, and the canvas is drawn only
// when the frame hash moved or a discrete input came in (a press, a release, a wheel notch, a key) — a page at rest costs a
// layout and no pixels, as on the desktop. A press, a release, a wheel notch and a key each run their frame on the event,
// so a quick input cannot land two events inside one frame and lose one.
//
// Two lifetimes, because a dev server's hot re-mount needs them apart (browser/serve.ts's `hot` event):
//   - the **host** is one a page load: the canvas and its context, the wasm instance and Clay's state in it, the font, the
//     DOM listeners, the pointer and the wheel queue. It is made once and kept on `globalThis`, so a re-imported bundle —
//     which has its own copy of this module — finds it instead of a second canvas loop;
//   - a **session** is one page: the Solid tree, the frame, the drawer, the rAF loop and `window.__page`. A re-mount builds
//     the new tree and disposes the old session's root, and the host carries over what was never the page's.
// A page opts in with `hot: true` (`?hot=0` is the old full reload); the bundle re-imported is this one, so its own
// `mountPage` finds the host and becomes the next session instead of a second page.
