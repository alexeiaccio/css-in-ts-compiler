### Patch Changes

- 337af7e: effect 4.0.6 (from 4.0.0) in the packages that depend on it, and every package rebuilt with vite-plus 1.4.0 (tsdown 0.23.1): the bundles change shape, the API does not. `dist/` is no longer tracked in the repository, the release builds it.

### Minor Changes

- a9b28e5: New package `@cssints/gradient-2d`: `meshGradient("red, blue; green, yellow")` is the spec's `mesh-gradient()` where the browser has it (the `@supports` switch), else a canvas that a runtime draws, bicubic in oklab, as the background. No browser has the function yet. Positions and the `by`/`with` control points are build errors for now. css-grammar gives `css.types.gradient.mesh-gradient` and `freeform-gradient` own BCD entries (`version_added: false` for the tracked browsers), read only where BCD has no key, so the runtime ships to the builds whose targets lack them.
