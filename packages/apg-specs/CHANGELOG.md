## 0.12.0

No changes in this release.

## 0.11.0

### Patch Changes

- 20c14ca: `parseScenarioFile` takes `unknown` rather than `Schema.Json`: a scenario file arrives as a JSON import, whose type has no index signature, so a copy of a test could not pass `tsc` without a cast. The schema was already the check that matters.

## 0.6.1

### Patch Changes

- 337af7e: effect 4.0.6 (from 4.0.0) in the packages that depend on it, and every package rebuilt with vite-plus 1.4.0 (tsdown 0.23.1): the bundles change shape, the API does not. `dist/` is no longer tracked in the repository, the release builds it.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- `@cssints/headless`: `createResizablePanels`, a group of N panes and N-1 separators — percent sizes that always sum to 100, per-pane min/max, collapsible panes, arrows and Home/End as pair moves, Enter to collapse and restore, a pointer drag that re-solves from the pointerdown snapshot, controlled `sizes` + `onSizesChange`, and a `storageKey`. `@cssints/apg-specs`: `specs/patterns/resizable-panels.qnt` (not an APG pattern: a group of window splitters), its generated model, the bridge with the drag vocabulary, 11 scenarios under `scenarios/patterns/`, and the `patterns/` exports.

## 0.5.2

### Patch Changes

- 62d2a2a: `@cssints/apg-specs`, first release: the 43 APG and canvas Quint specs, their generated models, the scenario bridges and replay runner, and the ported scenario sets, the test oracle of `@cssints/headless`, as subpath exports (`/scenario`, `/apg/<pattern>.bridge`, `/apg/<pattern>.model.json`, `/scenarios/apg/*.json`, `/specs/apg/*.qnt`).
