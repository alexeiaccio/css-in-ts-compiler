# @cssints/headless

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 42f7313: `@cssints/headless`: `createField`, the ARIA contract of a form field (`controlProps`, `labelProps`, `hintProps`, `errorProps`: ids that are stable, `aria-describedby` listing the hint and then the error while they are shown, `aria-invalid` only when invalid, `required` with `aria-required`, nothing that points at a hidden id), and `createConfirm`, a promise-based `confirm({ title, description?, confirmLabel?, cancelLabel?, destructive? })` over `createDialogModal({ role: "alertdialog" })`: `true` on confirm, `false` on cancel, Escape or the backdrop, focus on the cancel button and back to the invoker, one request at a time (a second one rejects with `ConfirmPendingError`). Neither has an APG pattern, so neither has a Quint spec.

### Minor Changes

- `@cssints/headless`: `createResizablePanels`, a group of N panes and N-1 separators — percent sizes that always sum to 100, per-pane min/max, collapsible panes, arrows and Home/End as pair moves, Enter to collapse and restore, a pointer drag that re-solves from the pointerdown snapshot, controlled `sizes` + `onSizesChange`, and a `storageKey`. `@cssints/apg-specs`: `specs/patterns/resizable-panels.qnt` (not an APG pattern: a group of window splitters), its generated model, the bridge with the drag vocabulary, 11 scenarios under `scenarios/patterns/`, and the `patterns/` exports.

## 0.5.2

No changes in this release.

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- 7dae24c: `@cssints/headless`, first release: headless APG widgets on Solid 2 (state and DOM attribute objects, no styling), each conformance-checked in Chromium against its Quint spec and the ported scenarios.
