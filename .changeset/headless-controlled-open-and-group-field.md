`@cssints/headless`: two ARIA gaps the styled kit hit. `createMenu` takes a controlled open state — `open`, `defaultOpen` and `onOpenChange` on top of `createControllable` — and every intent that opens or closes (the trigger's click and keys, Escape, an item's activation, Tab, `openMenu` / `closeMenu`) is a request the host may ignore; a rejected request leaves the focus where it was, as `menu-button.qnt` models it. `createCheckboxGroup` takes the name, the description and the error `createField` gives a control: `label` (`aria-label`) or `labelledby`, `describedby`, `invalid` / `error` (`aria-invalid`, the error id in `aria-describedby`, and an `errorProps` element that is `role="alert"` while it is shown), plus the group element's `id`. `menu-button.qnt` changed minimally: a host write of the open value it already has moves no focus, because no widget can observe it; regenerated, nothing else moved.
