"@cssints/devtools": patch
---

The OpenCode plugin of the devtools is the main entry of the package, so OpenCode loads it by the package name: `"plugins": ["@cssints/devtools"]` in opencode.jsonc (checked on OpenCode 2.0.27, which said "Plugin entrypoint not found" for a package with no `.` export). The `@cssints/devtools/opencode` subpath stays.
